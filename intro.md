Introduction
===========

I have always had a fascination with people who perfect their craft. Videos of chefs creating hot buns with their hands moving faster than my eyes can keep track of. Olympic atheletes optimizing years of their life to win a competition that takes less than 10 seconds. Musicians spending 10 thousands hours or more playing their instrument, to learn to have complete control over the sound that they produce.

People who go above and beyond the level of skill needed to be employed. People who optimize their whole lives around perfecting their art. 

I also want to be the best that I can be as a programmer. What happens if we take a perfectionist view of the craft of programming? What if you optimize your whole life around being the best programmer that you can be?

Using these strategies, I gained the ability to write complex programs quickly.
