Mentality
============

The ideal mentality of a programmer is one with mild depression and anxiety. Programmers need to always feel low-status. 

This goes against a lot of modern popular-psychology, so it is probably a surprise.

Humans are a social creature. We are insulated from the harshness of nature by our community of other humans. And so we have a strong evolutionarily programmed instinct to gain and maintain status.

High status individuals are cared for when they are sick, they are gifted the resources they need to survive, they have access to mates.
Low status individuals in our evolutionary history, they often die without reproducing, or they don't have access to the resources they need to care for their offspring.

And so we have evolved in a kind of binary fashion. Our bodies and minds undergo radical changes if we are high or low status, to optimize for that situation.

If a person feels like they are high status, then they optimize for maintaining their high status position. They conserve their energy, because at any random moment, a rival could challenge them. They need to be ready to fight to defend their statused position at any time, and so they try to conserve their energy for when it is time to fight. They become less intelligent, less able to maintain focus, and more agressive.

If a person feels like they are low status, then their body and mind optimize very differently. Their body slows down, and their mind speeds up. They find it hard to get out of bed, and catch themselves spending time staring into space, lost in thought. They spend their time scheming, trying to come up with a strategy to obtain a high status position. 

A person who is depressed, their brain is burning through calories at a much faster rate. They can solve math problems faster, and with more accuracy. They can maintain focus longer, and are more creative.

If you are in a low status position, then maintaining the correct mentality is easy. But if you are successful as a programmer, you will eventually be in a high status position.

This is a common problem among programmers. When they are young and poor, they are very good at programming, and as soon as they find success it becomes impossible for them to write code.
Some people say it is because they got old, but this process happens to programmers at any age.

So maintaining your ability to program, it is a psychological challenge. If you become successful, you need to create the feeling that you are in a dangerous position, that no one cares about you.

I am still not sure how to best avoid this problem.
It seems to be helpful to spend time thinking about your own mortality, to read stories where you can identify with low-status characters, and to listen to music that talks about dangerous low-status situations.

Excessive depression is eventually harmful to your ability to program. If you can't lift your hands up to type, that means you are too despressed and should dial it back.
If you are so anxious that your memory is severly impacted, that can harm your ability to program as well.
A constant adrenaline filled panic attack is not productive.
