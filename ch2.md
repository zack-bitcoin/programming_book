Chapter 2- Movement and Stillness
==========

Spending many hours programming is hard. It is physically and mentally exhausting.

Maintaining the same position for hours on end while typing, it is hard on your body. Humans are not designed to be still for such long periods of time. You need to maintain good posture the entire time you are programming. If your posture fails, then you will quickly destroy your wrists, your shoulders, your back, and your nerves. You will get permanent injuries and lose more than your ability to program.

Maintaining posture is very difficult, especially when you are distracted by the programming problem that you want to solve.

If you are too relaxed, then your body will droop, putting unnecessary stress from gravity on your tendons, joints, and nerves. Imagine a hunched over back, so common among programmers today. This same kind of failure can occur all over your body. Hands can droop at the wrist. Arms can droop at the shoulder. Nerve damage can cause permanent injuries that will severly impact your ability to program.

If you are too tense, then your muscles will be blocking blood flow. The muscle tension can cause stress on your tendons, joints, and nerves, just like gravity stress.

In order to avoid these injuries, you need to be strong. You need a strong back. You need strong forearms to protect your wrists. You need a strong endurance.

If you feel any physical pain while programming, you need to stop. You need to take a look at your posture, and make the adjustments to be comfortable. Do not push through physical pain.

If you feel mental pain while programming, or muscular exhaustion, you need to continue. You need to have the endurance to push through the pain, to maintain focus even when your body is screaming at you to be distracted or take a rest.

One good way to maintain my forearm and back strength is with pull-ups. If you have never done pull-ups before, then you will want to start with something easier. Hanging from a bar by your hands is a good way to build up strength in your forearms to eventually be able to do pull ups, and it helps to avoid wrist injuries while programming. If you find a lower bar, you can do a combination of a pull-up with a squat, which allows you to develop your back muscles to eventually be able to do pull-ups.

20 pull-ups per day seems to be sufficient to maintain your back strength for programming. You want each pull up to be done slowly, so you get the most out of them and minimize the risk of injury. 

When you do pull-ups, or any kind of weight exercise, it is very important to maintain good form. If there is stress on your joints in a sideways direction, you can permanently damage them.
During exercise your muscles should burn, but if you feel any pain in your joints, that means your form is wrong.
Make sure you are engaging your back muscles while doing the pull up. You will know you are doing it right because it is a lot easier when you use your back instead of just your arms. Imaging forcing your elbow downwards.
It is easier to engage your back muscles if you start the pull-up motion by limply hanging from the bar, and you engage your shoulders first, like the reverse of a shrug.

Another good exercise for your shoulders and back is push-ups. A full push-up may be too difficult at first. To start, you can have your feet on the ground, and your hands on some raised platform. This way your arms are supporting less of your weight. Over time you can lower the platform until you are doing a normal push-up.

Before I started doing pull-ups and push-ups to maintain my back strength, I used to suffer some back pain while programming. Once I lost 2 weeks. Every time I tried programming, it was unbearable pain. A lot of other daily tasks became nearly impossible as well. Back strength is critical to being able to program.

Mental endurance and physical endurance are the same thing. You are pushing your metabolism to the limit, seeing how quickly your body can process calories. In order to focus your mind for longer periods, you need to train your body to work for longer continuous periods. You should get your heart rate up to 180 beats per minute, for 20 minutes continuously, every day.

When I was studying physics in university, me and other students would work on the problem sets together. At some point during my studies I started doing regular endurance exercise. And right away, there was a clear difference between me and the other students. I could push through the entire problem set continuously, and they would frequently get tired and lose focus and need a break. Endurance makes a big difference in your ability to focus.


Avoiding excess tension while programming is difficult. There are 2 important factors to avoid tension.
1) you need the self-awareness to realize when you are tense, so you can do something about it.
2) you need the flexibility to be able to maintain good posture without depending on muscles forcing you into that posture.

Self-awareness comes from spending time thinking about how your body feels. Take a deep breath, and feel what you feel.

Flexibility comes from stretching or yoga.
If you were raised in a western culture, then you probably use chairs a lot, which causes inflexibility in parts of your hips.
You will know you have this problem if you feel pain in your lower back or in your lower abdomen.
Maintaining a relaxed flat-footed squat position is a good exercise to fix this. You may need to start with a book or something under your heels until your hamstrings are more flexible.

Staying still very long is not natural, and it will eventually destroy your body no matter how careful you are to maintain posture.
Programming should be done in increments of about 40 minutes.
The first 5 minutes, you review your notes about what you need to get done. Then 30 minutes of trying to accomplish that goal. Then you spend the last 5 minutes writing notes about where you are in progess so far, and what needs to get done next.
After your 40 minutes of programming, it is good to stand up, walk a bit, take a drink of water, and focus your eyes on something further away than the computer screen. You can keep thinking about your software prolem while resting your body.

It is a good idea to experiment with different programming setups to find what works well for you. Standing desks, having the monitor on the other side of the room, alternative keyboards, they can be a big benefit.

You should never be completely still while programming. Your body should keep rocking back and forth, to adjust where the weight is sitting on your joints, and change which muscles are in tension so that your bloodflow isn't blocked in any one spot for too long. Listening to music can be a good way to get into a rhythm of movement.

Sleeping twice a day works well for me. That way, when I start programming again after my nap, my mind is refreshed and I have more energy to continue.
