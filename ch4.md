Editor
=========

Your text editor is the interface between you and the code you are writing.

It is critical that your editor should never distract you from the problem you are trying to solve. If you need to stop and think about how to do something with your editor, that is a disaster. It may seem like you are only losing a fraction of a second, but even very small distractions end up hugely impacting your ability to program. If you lose a fraction of a second in a distraction, that can be enough to cause you to forget some aspect of the problem you are trying to solve, and if you take longer to solve one part of the problem, that means there is more time for you to forget other parts of the problem. So small distractions, they waste time exponentially.

When you are typing, you need to be able to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. If you need to look down at the keyboard or mouse at any time, that will make your eyes tired, it will cause you to lose your place when you look back up at the screen, you will waste time re-reading the code to know where you were. These wasted seconds make a big difference in how quickly you can accomplish tasks.

A good editor should allow you to keep your hands on the home row of keys at all times while programming. If you need to move a hand over to the mouse, or to the arrow keys, this will slow you down.

The mouse should never be used while programming, it is too inprecise in it's movements. You will waste your focus on trying to get the cursor to the correct spot to click, and forget aspects of the problem you are trying to solve.

There are certain things you need to know how to do with your editor that are instinctive. You don't need to waste any thought to accomplish these basic things.

* Moving your cursor up, down, left, or right.
* Moving your cursor to the start or end of the current line.
* Copy-pasting code.
* Searching for a word, and moving your cursor there.
* Centering the page where your cursor is.
* Simultaniously having 2 locations in the code open at once, so you can read one while writing the other, or move code from one part to the other.
* Saving your file.
* Opening a different file.
* Having a command line open at the same time as your code, so you can test the code while editing it.
* Copy-paste into the command line to test code.
* Copy-pasting from the command line into your code to save something that you confirmed works.

I had been using standard Emacs, but holding down the control key all the time started to cause serious pain in my pinky finger on my left hand, so I had to switch to VI key bindings. When you are choosing your editor, it is probably best to start with something that doesn't cause pain to use.

VI or an editor with VI key bindings is nice because every time you SSH into a server, VI is already available.
